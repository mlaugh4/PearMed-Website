      <h3>Introducing Bosc!</h3>
      <span>Oct 10, 2016</span>
      <img src="app/bosc_logo.png" alt="" style="width:50%" align="left">
      <p style="width:100%">What some are considering the biggest product launch since the iPhone, Bosc is the culmination of many months of research with radiologists, surgeons, patients, and health researchers. 2d greyscale visualizations tell an incomplete story and force unnecessary extrapolation between image interpretation and real anatomy in the operating room. Bosc introduces collaborative preparation on volumetric structures that we hope will significantly improve diagnosis, better educate patients and their loved ones, and shorten operating times. <br>

        Bosc lets anyone upload their voxel MR or CT images to their private cloud server, convert them into VR-compatible artifacts, and explore them with their hands. Users will soon be able to measure, annotate, and capture AV recordings that they can easily share with peers, anywhere in the world. <br>

        Early users include University of California and University of Washington. </p>

      <h3>Recap from inaugural HoloLens Hackathon</h3>
      <span>May 25, 2016</span>
      <p>The challenge was to create a simulation that trained medical practitioners how to guide a catheter into the right side of a patient's heart, then make a precise puncture in the middle of the heart to gain access to the left side of the heart. We wanted to understand how augmented reality could improve this very important and widely used technique.</p>
