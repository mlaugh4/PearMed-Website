      <p>Ryan James is a PhD candidate in Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Washington. His research is focused on understanding how mixed reality can be used to improve traditional medical practices. His PhD committee consists of Beth Ripley, MD, PhD (neurosciences), Tom Furness, PhD (the father of virtual reality), Jim Brinkley, MD, PhD (biological structure), and John Gennari, PhD (physiology). Before he found his passion for solving health problems, he received a B.S. in computer science and soon after worked as a full stack developer at Microsoft. He is motivated by the medical issues that took members of his family too soon, and intrigued by the way mixed reality experineces can make data easier to understand and use.</p>
